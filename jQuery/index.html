    <h1>jQuery Demo</h2>
  </div>
  <p class="intro">jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. It makes things like HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, animation, and Ajax much simpler with an easy-to-use API that works across a multitude of browsers. Let's try it out! Follow these instructions to see what it can do:</p>
  <div class='shape' id='triangle'></div>
  <div class='shape' id='square'></div>
  <div class='shape' id='circle'></div>
  <div class='shape' id='rounded-rectangle'></div>
  <ol class="instructions">
    <li>
      Add two <code>script</code> tags at the bottom of this page's body. Connect one to <code>index.js</code> and the other to <code>assets/jquery.min.js</code>.
    </li> 
    <li>
      Reload the page and see what happens!
    </li> 
    <li>
      Go into <code>index.js</code> and use jQuery to select and change the text color on all these <code>&ltli&gt</code> list items. Choose whatever color you want!
    </li>  
    <li>
      Set up a jQuery click listener on the triangle -> use the <code>$(selector)</code> syntax to target the #triangle id. Then use jQuery's <code>.click()</code> method and have it execute a function that targets the triangle and makes it fade away (try the jQuery <code>.fadeOut()</code> method.
    </li>    
    <li>
      Set up a jQuery mouseenter listener on the square -> use the <code>$(selector)</code> syntax to target the #square id. Then use jQuery's <code>.mouseenter()</code> method and have it execute a function that targets the square and changes its color using the jQuery <code>.css()</code> method.
    </li>  
    <li>
      Let's make the circle shrink on mouseenter! We'll use the same syntax that you see in sections #1 and #2. But instead of changing the CSS directly, we'll use jQuery's built-in <code>.animate()</code> method. Into the animate method, we pass an <code>object</code> that specifies how we want the animation to work. To make the circle 25px shorter on mouseenter, we can use the strings <code>'height'</code> as the key and <code>'-=25px'</code> as the value. We should also shrink its width, to keep it a circle instead of an oval, so add another key-value pair that changes its width!
    </li>   
    <li>
      The circle is shrinking out of control - it actually disappears if you mouse over it too much! Let's make it so that it grows when the mouse leaves the circle, giving it a mouseover effect of shrinking and then growing again when we leave. Use jQuery's <code>.mouseleave()</code> method to achieve this.
    </li>   
    <li>
      Lastly, do something crazy with the rectangle! This is your own creation. Look at the jQuery documentation and make something exciting for the user. When the user clicks or touches the rectangle, make it spin or flip or change 20 colors while shrinking and flying across the screen.
    </li>    
  </ol>
