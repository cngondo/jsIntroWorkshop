    <h1>Conditional Exercises</h2>

  <p class="intro">With conditionals, we tell javascript when or when not to execute certain pieces of code. Conditionals rely on the evaluation of expressions that return a boolean value of either true or false.</p>
  <ol class="instructions">
    <li>
      We have an automated system that checks IDs at our restaurant. The system relies on a series of logical checks that makes sure we should admit the ID holder if they're over 18. Also, if they're over 60, we give them a 'Senior Discount'. An engineer built a function with most of the logic but disappeared before she could put the boolean conditions in to test the <code>age</code> variable. Go to <code>index.js</code> and put in the proper conditions!
    </li>     
    <li>
      Once you're done, save <code>index.js</code> and refresh this page. In the console, if there are no errors, you should be able to test out the function. Type in <code>checkID(15)</code>. Also test <code>checkID(80)</code> and <code>checkID(35)</code>.
    </li>
