    <h1>Object Exercise 1: Who Heals The Healer?</h2>
  </div>

  <p class="intro" style="margin-top: 30px;">A lost medical robot was found trudling around near your encampment. People in your community desperately need it. Unfortunately, its software seems to have been hacked and it has a lot of errors. You must fix it!</p>
  <ol class="instructions">
    <li>
      Using the Chrome dev console, diagnose the problems and attempt to debug the robot's software in <code>index.js</code>. There are two main objects: the robot itself, and an external instruction set. Both need fixing! You can see the errors already in the console - on the right-hand side, you'll see <code>index.js:#</code>, where the # corresponds to the line number where the error is. Pay close attention and be patient! Coding requires a lot of debugging. Hint: there are a total of 4 syntax bugs.
    </li> 
    <li>
      Now the script runs without errors, and the <code>greet</code> method works (test it out by passing a name (<code>string</code>) as the argument to <code>medicalRobot.greet()</code>)! But it won't perform its <code>heal</code> method (try passing a bodypart (<code>string</code>) as an argument to <code>medicalRobot.heal()</code>). It seems to be locked to a certain location. Figure out how to unlock it.
    </li>
    <li>
      Even when you've fixed eR42, eR42 still sometimes makes mistakes (try the <code>heal</code> method a few times on different bodyparts) - it says that the condition is <code>undefined</code>. Why is that? Fix it. Hint: Math.random() produces a number between 0 and 1, not including 1.
    </li>
    <li>
      Currently the eR42 has a 50% chance of healing the patient - that's pretty bad. Adjust it up to 85%. 100% wouldn't be any fun, would it?
    </li>
    <li>
      Wait a second... if something is diagnosed as 'missing', can eR42 heal it? I don't think so. Fix the <code>performHeal</code> method of the <code>medicalInstructionSetV14</code> object by implementing a <code>if</code> conditional that automatically returns false if the condition is 'missing'.
    </li> 
  </ol>
